# Sass and Webpack

This repo shows how to handle a Sass environment using webpack.

Automated processing of Sass files
Tools:
The main build tool used is Webpack V4 (^4.23.1), our config uses the following loaders
* sass-loader (^7.1.0) (NodeSass ^4.9.4)
* sass-resources-loader (^1.3.4)
* postcss-loader (PostCss ^3.0.0)
  * browserslist (included in postcss)
  * autoprefixer (^9.3.1)
  * cssnano (^4.1.7)
* css-loader (^1.0.1)
* MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader (^0.4.4)

sass-loader
Used to parse Scss and transform it into css.

sass-resources-loader
Used to prepend utilities files, which contain variables and different helpers.
NB. The util files must not contain normal css, otherwise it will be outputted before each bundles file.

postcss-loader
PostCss is a css postprocessor that allows operations like prefixing, linting and more. Its use is tied with browserslist.
Configured with a postcss.config.js.

browserslist
Used to specify the browsers we decide to support. The list can be found here.
To specify the browsers we use a .browserlistrc in the src folder.

autoprefixer
PostCss plugin that adds prefixes to css properties as per Caniuse and our browser list.

cssnano
Used to minify as much as possible our css files.
TBD Find the right config to be sure not to break the file.

css-loader
Used to parse css @import and url().

 MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader
Used to extract css from the otherwise js output of Webpack.

Pipeline
1. sass-resource-loader
Prepends our files imported in utilities.js
1. sass-loader
Transforms Scss in Css, using NodeSass.
1. postcss-loader
Postprocesses css doing the following:
  1. autoprefixer
Adds the prefixes as per browserslist
  1. cssnano (PRODUCTION only)
Minifies the css, depending on config in postcss.config.js
1. css-loader
Parses the @import and url() in the css
1. MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader
Extracts the css from the webpack parsed js
